This is a simple program that test the collision of 5 cubes moving within the view frustum. Collision is checked for each cube using the seperation of axis method. Pressing the 'r' key will reset the cubes back to thier original position and give them new random rotation and velocity. Pressing the 'q' or 'esc' will close the program. Opengl and Glut are needed to compile this program. This program was only tested on linux.
